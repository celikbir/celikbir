### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am DoÄŸukan. But they call me douÅŸ mostly. I am a sophomore student at Akdeniz University. I am into frontend but also interested in game programming. I joined a game jame in 2021. It was online but I had fun too much. This year I worked in [Akdeniz Google Developer Students Club](https://gdsc.community.dev/akdeniz-university/) as Research-Development Team Leader. I became an instructor and taught students HTML-CSS.

You can contact me via [e-mail](mailto:dogukancelik9@outlook.com).
