### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Dogukan. But they call me Dogus mostly. I am a sophomore student at Akdeniz University. I am into frontend but also interested in game programming. I joined a game jame in 2021. It was online but I had fun too much. This year I work in [Akdeniz Google Developer Students Club](https://gdsc.community.dev/akdeniz-university/) and I want to organize a gamejam.

You can contact me via e-mail.
